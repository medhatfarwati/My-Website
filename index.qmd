Hi, I am **Medhat Farwati**, currently a CRSP student at **Case Western Reserve University** and a **Cardiology Fellow** at the **Cleveland Clinic Main Campus**.

The purpose of this website is to showcase data analyses for **Project B** as part of the **CRSP 431 Class**. In the future, this site will also host additional analyses, insights, and visualizations related to the field of cardiology and beyond.

Feel free to explore and follow along with the progress of the project. Stay tuned for updates!
